# Redacter

Copy & Redact cli tool to securely copy and redact files removing Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
across various sources and destinations and utilizing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities.

The tool doesn't implement DLP itself, but rather relies on external models such as
Google Cloud Platform's DLP API.

DLP is optional and should be enabled with `--redact` (`-d`) option.
Without DLP enabled, the tool will copy all files without redaction.
With DLP enabled, the tool will redact files based on the DLP model and skip unsupported files.

## Source and destinations

Source/destination can be a local file or directory, or a file in GCS, S3, and others:

- Local file: `/tmp/file.txt` or `/tmp` for whole directory recursive copy
- GCS: `gs://bucket/file.txt` or `gs://bucket/test-dir/` for whole directory recursive copy
- S3: `s3://bucket/file.txt` or `s3://bucket/test-dir/` for whole directory recursive copy
- Zip archive: `zip://tmp/archive.zip`
- Clipboard: `clipboard://`

## DLP and redacters

### Google Cloud Platform DLP

To be able to use GCP DLP you need to:

- authenticate using `gcloud auth application-default login` or provide a service account key
  using `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
- provide a GCP project id using `--gcp-project-id` option.

Additionally you can provide the list of user defined info types using `--gcp-dlp-stored-info-type` option.

### AWS Comprehend

To be able to use AWS Comprehend DLP you need to authenticate using `aws configure` or provide a service account.
To provide an AWS region use `--aws-region` option since AWS Comprehend may not be available in all regions.
AWS Comprehend DLP is only available for unstructured text files.

### Microsoft Presidio

To be able to use Microsoft Presidio DLP you need to have a running instance of the Presidio API.
You can use Docker to run it locally or deploy it to your infrastructure.
You need to provide the URLs for text analysis and image redaction endpoints using `--ms-presidio-text-analyze-url` and
`--ms-presidio-image-redact-url` options.

### Gemini LLM

To be able to use Gemini as DLP/redacter you need to:

- authenticate using `gcloud auth application-default login --client-id-file=<client_secret-file>.json` or provide a
  service account key
  using `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
  Please note that you need to also configure OAuth setup following the
  official [instructions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/oauth#set-cloud).
- provide a GCP project id using `--gcp-project-id` option.

### Open AI LLM

To be able to use Open AI LLM you need to provide an API key using `--open-ai-api-key` command line option.
Optionally, you can provide a model name using `--open-ai-model` option. Default is `gpt-4o-mini`.

## Multiple redacters

You can specify multiple redacters using `--redact` option multiple times.
The tool will apply redaction in the order of the redacters specified.

## PDF redaction

PDF redaction is supported by rendering PDF files as images and redacting them.
To render and convert PDF files the tool uses external library `Pdfium` (the C++ PDF library used by the Google Chromium
project).
This library needs to be installed separately on your system.

Installation instructions:

- Download the latest release from, for example,
  here [Pdfium releases](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases) for your system.
- Extract the archive and copy library file `libpdfium.so` to the one of the following directory:
    - The path the redacter tool installed (such as `/usr/local/bin`)
    - The path that resides with redacter tool `/usr/local/lib/` if you have installed the tool in `/usr/local/bin`
    - The path with system libs like `/usr/lib/`.

If library is detected correctly it will be reported in the tool output as.
> PDF to image support: âœ“ Yes

## OCR

The tool supports OCR for images and PDF files using [ocrs engine](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs).
To enable OCR you need to download the OCR models:

- https://ocrs-models.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/text-detection.rten
- https://ocrs-models.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/text-recognition.rten

and copy those files to the `~/.cache/ocrs` directory.

## Examples:

```sh
# Copy and redact a file from local filesystem to GCS
redacter cp -d gcp-dlp --gcp-project-id <your-gcp-project-with-dlp> sensitive.png gs://my-bucket-name/test/test.png  
```

The tool supports recursive copy of multiple files from directory:

```sh
redacter cp s3://my-bucket-name/sensitive-files/ tmp/
```

Zip archives are supported too:

```sh
redacter cp gs://my-bucket-name/sensitive-files/ zip://tmp/sensitive-files.zip
```

Filter files by name:

```sh
redacter cp -f "*.jpg" ...
```

and/or by size:

```sh
redacter cp -m 1024 ...
```

MS Presidio redacter:

```sh
redacter cp -d ms-presidio --ms-presidio-text-analyze-url http://localhost:5002/analyze --ms-presidio-image-redact-url http://localhost:5003/redact ...
```

Override media types based on filenames:

```sh
redacter cp --mime-override "text/plain=*.bin" ...
```

Redact an image from clipboard:

```sh
redacter cp clipboard:// tmp/image/ ...
```

## List (LS) command

For convenience, the tool also supports listing files in the source directory so you can see what files will be copied:

```
Usage: redacter ls [OPTIONS] <SOURCE>

Arguments:
  <SOURCE>  Source directory or file such as /tmp, /tmp/file.txt or gs://bucket/file.txt and others supported providers

Options:
  -m, --max-size-limit <MAX_SIZE_LIMIT>    Maximum size of files to copy in bytes
  -f, --filename-filter <FILENAME_FILTER>  Filter by name using glob patterns such as *.txt
  -h, --help                               Print help
```

Example: list files in the GCS bucket:

```sh
redacter ls gs://my-little-bucket/my-big-files/
```

## Security considerations

- Your file contents are sent to the DLP API for redaction. Make sure you trust the DLP API provider.
- The accuracy of redaction depends on the DLP model, so don't rely on it as the only security measure.
- The tool was mostly design to redact files internally. Not recommended use it in public environments without proper
  security measures and manual review.
- Integrity of the files is not guaranteed due to DLP implementation specifics. Some of the formats such as
  HTML/XML/JSON
  may be corrupted after redaction since they treated as text.
- Use it at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any data loss or security breaches.

## Recommended DLP providers

Google Cloud Platform DLP is recommended for accurate and customizable redaction, since it is one of the most advanced
DLP on the market.
Image redaction in LLM models right now results in not very accurate redaction, however text redaction is quite good.

For the most protection, you can use multiple DLP providers in the order of the most accurate to the least accurate.
